# Data-Double-Checker
This script takes a file as input, default: Data.txt.
The data should be arranged in lines. Each line marks a data point.
The script takes each line(data point) and adds it to a list, default: _Data[].
Then, the script identifies which data points are doubled in the list _Data[] and makes a new unique list called __Data[] with no doubles in the data points.
Then the script creates a txt file called uData.txt and writes the content of the list __Data[] into uData.txt
